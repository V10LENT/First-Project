            <p class="btmbl">The Batmobile first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939), where it was depicted as an ordinary-looking red car. Its appearance has varied but, since its earliest appearances, the Batmobile has had a prominent bat motif, typically including wing-shaped tailfins. Armored in the early stages of Batman's career, it has been customized over time and is the most technologically advanced crime-fighting asset in Batman's arsenal, barring the Batplane.</p>

                <p class="btmbl2">The Batsuit (or Bat-Suit) is the costume of DC Comics's fictional superhero Batman, who appears in their American comic books. The suit has been depicted in various artistic iterations, and the stories themselves have described Batman as modifying the details of his costume from time to time typically using military and SWAT standards materials and technology that evolved into an advanced combat suit. However, it usually consists of a gray body suit.</p>
